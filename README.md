# **Overview of Git and GitHub Documentation**

The MkDocs project provides a step-by-step guide for beginners to understand and use Git and GitHub. It covers topics such as installing Git on different operating systems, creating and managing repositories, understanding Git commands, and navigating GitHub. Additionally, it explains how to create a GitHub account, commit changes, push/pull code, and merge branches. The documentation also uses clear visuals and practical examples to simplify the learning process.

These are the sections that are included in the document

- Installing Git on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Commonly used Git commands
- Setting up a GitHub account
- Creating a repository on GitHub

# Planning and Collaborating

We divided the work between Git and GitHub topics. One cohort member focused on Git-related tasks, such as installation and basic commands, while the other concentrated on GitHub topics, including account creation, repository setup, and navigation. This division allowed us to manage the workload efficiently while ensuring both aspects were covered.

# Creation of the Guide

We worked together using Git and GitHub to keep track of our changes and avoid conflicts. We wrote the content in simple Markdown, and then used MkDocs to organize and display everything in a clean format. Our aim was to make the guide easy to follow for beginners who are new to Git and GitHub.

# Conclusion

To wrap things up, this guide was made to help beginners get comfortable with Git and GitHub. We broke down the key concepts, like installation and using basic commands, into easy-to-understand steps. The aim was to make sure even first-time users could get the hang of using these tools without any struggles.
