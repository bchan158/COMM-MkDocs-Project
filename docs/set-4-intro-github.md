# Introduction to Github

## Overview

### What is Github?

GitHub is a web-based platform that makes it easier to manage and share coding projects. It builds on Git, a tool that helps track changes to files, by providing a place where projects can be stored and worked on from anywhere. Imagine it as an online workspace where multiple people can collaborate on the same project without losing track of who made what changes.

    A common misunderstanding that Git and GitHub are closely related because their names sound similar, but they are actually completely different tools.

### Learning Outcomes (Beginners)

By end of this guide, you will be able to:

- **Create Github account** – A platform to store, share, and track changes in your coding projects.
- **Create and manage repositories** – Set up and organize your projects on GitHub.
- **Clone repositories** – Copy a project from GitHub to your computer to work on it.
- Commit changes – Save your work and note the changes you’ve made.
- **Push and pull changes** – Upload your changes to GitHub or get updates from others.
- **Work with branches** – Create separate versions of your project to make changes without affecting the main one.
- **Merge changes** – Combine your branch changes with the main project when you're done.

It may seem overwhelming at first, but don’t worry - step-by-step guides are available to help you through each part!

### Personal repositories

The left sidebar is the user profile and repository pages shows a list of repositories a user created or contributed to. The naming convention typically follows the format of "owner/repository-name" (where "owner" is the user or organization that created the repository, and "repository-name" is the project name).
